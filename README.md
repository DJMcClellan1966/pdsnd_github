### Project Title
Udacity BikeShare project using python and git

### Description
Analyse bikeshare data from [Motivate]( https://www.motivateco.com/) using python along with git to gather data from the files.

### Files used
Bikeshare files (https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/March/5aab379c_bikeshare-2/bikeshare-2.zip)
Includes `bikeshare.py`, a udacity template to assist students with their project. Data files in csv format, `chicago.csv`, `washington.csv`, 'new_york_city.csv`

### Credits
I used many examples from pandas and numpy documentation.  
I explored questions already asked in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to find examples.
[Jonathonsoma.com](http://jonathansoma.com/), classnotes on replacing values and strings helped with filling in missing values from washington.csv, on bikeshare lines 121 to 127.
[towardsdatascience.com](towardsdatascience.com), data cleaning with python and pandas:detecting missing values. An article on Oct 5, 2018, helped me explore data and missing values
